`flexDirection` controls which directions children of a container go. 
`row` goes left to right, `column` goes top to bottom, and you may be able to guess what the other two do. 
It works like `flex-direction` in CSS, except the default is `column`. 
See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction) for more details.

### Basic usage

```typescript
'flex-row' -> { flexDirection: 'row' }
'flex-row-reverse' -> { flexDirection: 'row-reverse' }
'flex-col' -> { flexDirection: 'column' }
'flex-col-reverse' -> { flexDirection: 'column-reverse' }
```
