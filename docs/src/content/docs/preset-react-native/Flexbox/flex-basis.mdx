`flexBasis` is an axis-independent way of providing the default size of 
an item along the main axis. Setting the `flexBasis` of a child is similar 
to setting the `width` of that child if its parent is a container with `flexDirection: row` 
or setting the height of a child if its parent is a container with `flexDirection: column`. 
The `flexBasis` of an item is the default size of that item, 
the size of the item before any `flexGrow` and `flexShrink` calculations are performed.

### Basic usage

```typescript
'basis-0' -> { flexBasis: 0 }
'basis-1' -> { flexBasis: 1 }
'basis-1/2' -> { flexBasis: '50%' }
'basis-full' -> { flexBasis: '100%' }
```
